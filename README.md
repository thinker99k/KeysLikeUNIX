# KeysLikeUNIX : Make your keyboard efficient

Have you ever thought why keyboard layout is so inefficient?\
Mostly used Ctrl and BackSpace is just hiding in very corner of keyboard,\
while rarely used Caps Lock key occupies golden place.

**This is UNFAIR!!**

In Linux there's system settings to reassign keys in one's taste, but Windows isn't.\
So, here's registries that reassign keys to make a UNIX-Like keyboard experience.

## Files

1. **unix.reg**

   Swaps Ctrl <-> CapsLock, and BackSpace <-> BackSlash
   
   
2. **reset.reg**

   Remove all key reassignments.


**Registry file works after reboot.**
